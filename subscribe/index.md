I send updates about the book to my [*Programming for Advanced Beginners*][subscribe] newsletter. This newsletter is a weekly email of specific, actionable tips about how to write cleaner code. [Subscribe][subscribe] now to learn something new about writing elegant code every single week and to be the first to know when I publish major book updates.

In addition, join thousands of other people and [subscribe to my main blog newsletter][blog-subscribe]. This is where I send all my other posts about security, programming, and a few other topics. It contains less immediately actionable advice but a lot more whimsy. [Here's a list of some of my favorite posts from the last 8 years][blog-subscribe].

You can also [follow me on Twitter][twitter], for all the good that will do you.
