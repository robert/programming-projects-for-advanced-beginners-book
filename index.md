## Here's the problem

Almost all books, videos, and websites about learning programming are either too easy or too difficult.

They assume that you are either a complete beginner who has never seen an if-statement before, or an advanced genius who has memorized every single technical definition in Wikipedia. But what if you're neither? What if you know most of the syntax and get the general idea, but don't know how to keep getting better? What if you're an *advanced beginner*?

Why, you read *Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners* of course.

## What is *Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners*?

*Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners* is a book of semi-guided projects. For each project you get a rough outline, a few pointers, and a couple of suggestions, but you have to do all the hard work of actually writing the code yourself. We talk in depth - but also in plain English - about the thought processes I went through when I was building the projects myself. We discuss different approaches to solving the same problems, and the tradeoffs between each.

By the end of the book, you'll have written twelve complex, satisfying programs, including a simulator for a Roomba vacuum cleaner, a procedural sentence generator, and an AI that can play Connect 4. You'll have taken your favorite programs off in your own direction, adding inspired features and extensions that come to you while developing the core project. You'll have spent fifty or more hours writing tidy, well-thought-through code, and you'll be absolutely certain that doing so was an incredible use of your time.

You'll understand advanced programming concepts that will make your code cleaner, more readable, and more modular. You'll know what those words actually mean and why they matter. You'll put these concepts into practice in your own project code as soon as you learn about them.

You'll understand how to plan and structure your own projects. You'll understand how to split out your programs' logic into crisp, modular components. You'll understand automated testing. You'll understand `class`es. And whenever you program in the future you'll have a little version of me sitting on your shoulder, gently reminding you about your new good habits, asking you supportive questions, and generally being more fun and entertaining than all your other friends.

## Who is Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners for?

This book is for you if:

* You're working towards your first programming job
* You're in your first (or second, or third) programming job but don't feel like you are getting any better
* You're in college and want a break from dry, esoteric algorithms
* You're mostly happy with your professional progress so far but just want a reminder of how much fun programming can be

Over the past year and a half I've held weekly [office hours][office-hours] in which I've talked with advanced beginners like you about the ups and downs and difficulties with learning programming. I've come to understand in depth the problems with the conventional tools and methods for teaching yourself to code.

"Write programs that solve your own problems" they say. But how do you know if these programs are too easy or too hard for you to work on at this point in your progression? Is your code not working because you missed out a semi-colon or because your entire premise is flawed and futile? "Read other people's code" they also say. OK, so you went to github.com - what do you click on next?

How are you supposed to know whether the code you've written is any good? If you know sixty percent of the basics then where do you find the other forty percent? Is there more to life than leetcode.com?

Some people have an inspiring friend, professor, or co-worker to show them the way. Now everyone else has *Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners*.

## How to read it

My goal is for *Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners* to be one of the best books ever written for people teaching themselves programming. I'm writing the book in the open and publishing it as I go so that I can get [rapid and repeated feedback][feedback] on it. You can [read the current version][read] online, and subscribe to my [Programming for Advanced Beginners newsletter][subscribe] for updates.
