My goal is for Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners to be one of the best books ever written about learning programming.

I'm writing the book in the open and publishing it as I go so that I can get rapid and repeated feedback on it. If you see a word that you don't understand then let me know so that I can define it properly. If you want more detail on a concept, let me know. If you want less detail on a concept, let me know. If you get stuck, let me know and I'll help you over the hump via email or Skype. If you finish a project and would like feedback, send me your code. And above all, if you get bored halfway through a project and give up, then for the love of god let me know.

If you don't have anything in particular to talk about but would still like to say hello, then I'd still love to hear from you. My contact details are at the top of this page.
